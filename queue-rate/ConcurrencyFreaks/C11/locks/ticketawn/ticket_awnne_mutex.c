/*
  * <h1>Ticket Lock with Array of Waiting Nodes</h1>
 * This is a variant of the Ticket Lock where each thread spins on its own node.
 *
 * <h2> Negative Egress variant </h2>
 * In this variant, the thread doing the unlock() uses the sign of the egress
 * to tell the next waiting thread whether it saw a waiting node or not.
 * Negative egress means that the next thread should spin on lockIsMine.
 *
 * <h2> Ticket Lock behavior </h2>
 * The Ticket Lock is described in section 2.2 by John Mellor-Crummey and
 * Michael Scott in 1991:
 * <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.173/www/currentsemester/readings/R06-scalable-synchronization-1991.pdf">
 * http://web.mit.edu/6.173/www/currentsemester/readings/R06-scalable-synchronization-1991.pdf</a>
 * <br>This variant's behavior is a follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> ticket == egress:   Works like a Ticket Lock
 * <li> ticket-1 == egress: Works like a ticket Lock
 * <li> ticket-2 >= egress: Uses the new mechanism
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2> Comparison with CLH </h2>
 * This algorithm does more work than CLH so it's not that better, but in a
 * machine where there is no single instruction atomic_exchange() or it is much
 * slower than atomic_fetch_add(), this technique could be better than CLH. <br>
 * There is an advantage over CLH: In Ticket AWN there is a single awn_node_t
 * instance per thread that is shared among all instances of Ticket AWN, while
 * on the CLH there must be one node per instance per thread. This means that
 * memory wise, if an array of MAX_THREADS is used for the Ticket AWN, the
 * Ticket AWN should consume slightly less memory overall:
 * <ul>
 * <li> CLH: sizeof(node) x Number of instances x MAX_THREADS
 * <li> Ticket AWN: (sizeof(node) x MAX_THREADS) + (sizeof(ptr) x Number of instances x maxArrayWaiters)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2> Happens-Before </h2>
 * Notice that on {@code unlock()} we write on {@code wnode.isLocked} and then
 * on {@code egress}, while on lock() we read {@code egress} and then
 * {@code wnode.islocked}, which creates a Happens-Before:
 * <ul>
 * <li>lock(): waitersArray.store() -> egress.load() -> lockIsMine.load()
 * <li>unlock(): waitersArray.load() -> lockIsMine.store() -> egress.store()
 * <li>unlock(): waitersArray.load() -> egress.store()
 * </ul>
 * <h2> Sample scenario </h2>
 * To understand how this mechanism works, imagine a sample scenario where
 * Thread 1 (T1) gets a ticket of 10:
 * <ul>
 * <li> egress is 10: T1 has the lock
 * <li> egress is 9: T1 will spin on egress waiting for it to become 10
 * <li> egress is 8: T1 will add its node to the waitersArray and check egress again:
 *   <li> egress is still 8: T1 will spin on lockIsMine
 *   <li> egress is now  -9: T1 will spin on egress (egress may be about to pass to 10)
 *   <li> egress is now   9: T1 will spin on egress (egress may be about to pass to 10)
 *   <li> egress is now -10: T1 will spin on lockIsMine (previous thread has seen T1's node)
 *   <li> egress is now  10: T1 has the lock
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2> Atomic Operations </h2>
 * Notice that in Ticket AWN the only atomic operation that is not a simple
 * load or store is the atomic_fetch_add() done at the beginning of the
 * lock() method. No other atomic_fetch_add(), or atomic_exchange() or
 * atomic_compare_exchange() are done on this algorithm, and several of the
 * atomic loads and stores can be done relaxed.
 *
 * <h2> Relaxed Atomic Operations </h2>
 * There are a few loads and stores than can be done relaxed. Here is the
 * list and the justification:
 * <ul>
 * <li> In lock(), the store on wnode->lockIsMine to false can be relaxed
 *      because it will become visible on the release-store of the wnode in
 *      the array and it will only be accessible from that instant in time.
 * <li> In unlock(), the first load on egress can be relaxed because it was
 *      read last by the same thread in lock() so it is guaranteed to be up
 *      to date.
 * <li> In unlock(), the store on the self entry of the array to NULL can be
 *      relaxed because it will become visible either with the store with
 *      release on the wnode->lockIsMine to true or on the egress to ticket+1.
 * <li> In unlock(), the store in egress of -(ticket+1) can be relaxed
 *      because before it there is a load with load with acquire of the array
 *      which prevents reordering above, and the store will become visible
 *      when we do the store with release of wnode->lockIsMine to true.
 * </ul>
