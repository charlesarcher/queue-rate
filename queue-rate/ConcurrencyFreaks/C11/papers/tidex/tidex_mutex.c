/* Thread ID EXchange Mutual Exclusion Lock (Tidex Mutex)
 *
 * This is a mutual exclusion lock which we discovered (or so it seams) and
 * is inspired by the Ticket Lock, but uses atomic_exchange() instead of
 * atomic_fetch_add().
 * The ingress and egress are not counters. The ingress represents thread ids
 * of the threads trying to acquire the lock, and the egress holds the thread
 * id of the thread that currently has the lock (or has just released it).
 * Each thread has two unique identifiers for which we use the thread id
 * and its negative value. Using the negative of a pthread_t is undefined
 * behavior according to the pthreads documentation, but in practice it
 * should be ok for all scenarios.
 * There is also a regular variable that holds state between lock() and
 * unlock() which we named {@code nextEgress}.
 *
 * Notice that the initial decision of whether to spin or enter the critical
 * section is reached in a wait-free way on x86 or other systems for which
 * atomic_exchange() is implemented with a single atomic instruction (XCHG in
 * the x86 case). This means this lock is starvation-free on x86.
 *
 * More info on this post:
 * http://concurrencyfreaks.com/2014/12/tidex-mutex-in-c11.html
 *
 * This implementation has no spinning and no padding
 *
 * TODO: try
 *  #define Pause() __asm__ __volatile__ ( "pause" : : : )
 * instead of sched_yield()

 * not. If it it is the same, then it is guaranteed to be up-to-date, and if
 * it is different we don't care. It can also 'seem' the same and no longer
