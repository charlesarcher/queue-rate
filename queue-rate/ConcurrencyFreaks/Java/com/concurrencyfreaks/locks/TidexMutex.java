/**
 * <h1>Thread-ID EXchange Mutual Exclusion Lock (Tidex Mutex)</h1>
 * 
 * This is a mutual exclusion lock which we discovered (or so it seams) and
 * is inspired by the Ticket Lock, but uses getAndSet() instead of getAndAdd().
 * The ingress and egress are not counters. The ingress represents thread ids 
 * of the threads trying to acquire the lock, and the egress holds the thread
 * id of the thread that currently has the lock (or has just released it).
 * Each thread has two unique identifiers for which we use the thread id 
 * and its negative value.
 * There is also a regular variable that holds state between lock() and 
 * unlock() which we named {@code nextEgress}. 
 * <p>
 * Notice that the initial decision of whether to spin or enter the critical
 * section is reached in a wait-free way on x86 or other systems for which
 * getAndSet() is implemented with a single atomic instruction (XCHG in
 * the x86 case). This means this lock is starvation-free on x86.
 * <p>
 * More details on this post:
 * <a href="http://concurrencyfreaks.com/2014/12/tidex-mutex.html">http://concurrencyfreaks.com/2014/12/tidex-mutex.html</a>

 * TODO: Make a reentrant version
 * TODO: Use a spinning technique similar to the one on StampedLock
