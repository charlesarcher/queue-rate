/**
 * <h1>Concurrent Linked List with Elected Unlink</h1>
 * A Linked List where add() are always done at the end of the list
 * and the remove() can be done anywhere but the unlinking operation
 * is done with an Elected pattern.
 * <p>
 * This implementation supports three major operations, whose Progress 
 * Conditions are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code add()} - Lock-Free
 * <li>{@code remove()} - Lock-Free
 * <li>{@code contains()} - Lock-Free
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * There are at least two non-trivial details in this data structure:
 * <li> <strong>Election Mechanism</strong> -
 *      This is a "Special One Pattern", also called "Election Pattern", and
 *      it consists of using an atomic variable, {@code unlinkGuard}, to 
 *      <i>elect</i> a thread that will be given a <i>special</i> task. 
 *      In this case, the special task is to unlink nodes whose {@code state}
 *      is {@code REMOVED}.
 * 
 * <li> <strong>List Traversal with Relaxed Atomics</strong> -
 *      The member Node.next is not qualified as a {@code volatile}, instead, 
 *      this is a <b>relaxed atomic</b>. We have atomicity guarantees from 
 *      the JVM for Node.next, and we only need to do an acquire-barrier if 
 *      Node.next is null, because Node.next can only take two values: null 
 *      (initial value), or a reference to the next Node instance in the list. 
 *      Once it has been assigned a non-null reference, the Node.next can only 
 *      be assigned another non-null reference.            
 * </ul>
 *
 * Compared to java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue, this data structure 
 * is not as "GC friendly" because each node that is unlinked, has a 
 * {@code next} that references another node that is possibly still in the 
 * linked list.
 * One way to address this is to use the same trick that the CLQ uses, and set
 * the {@code next} to itself after a node is unlinked. This would force 
 * traversal operations to restart from the head if they find a {@code next} 
 * that points to the same node. See CLQ.contains() and CLQ.succ() for an 
 * example of how this works.
 * <p>
 * The main advantage of this algorithm when compared with previously known
 * lock-free lists, is that the traversal of the list can be done without 
 * any barriers, at least until a {@code next} with null or a matching 
 * {@code item} are found.
 * This means that for algorithms like the one on the CLQ, the traversal of
 * the list implies O(n) volatile loads, while for the CLLElectedUnlink 
 * algorithm it is O(1) volatile loads.
 * On architectures like x86, where a volatile load (an acquire barrier in 
 * C++1x terms) comes for free, this won't make any difference in terms of
 * performance, but in architectures with a more relaxed model where the 
 * acquires have a price (like ARM), this may be able to provide some gains.
 * How big are those gains depends a lot on the difference in <i>cost</i>
 * between using a volatile load (load with acquire barrier) or a regular 
 * load (relaxed atomic load) on that particular architecture.
